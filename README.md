This is the repository for the Course Project for Chris Beam and Kendall Britton

There's a API test folder that requires you to set environment variables for `twitchAPIID`, `twitchAPIID`, `twitchAPIAccess`, and `youtubeAPIKey`. To obtain the `twitchAPIAccess` key, you need to use the TwitchAuth.go file in the APITest folder (the key obtained expires after some time).
